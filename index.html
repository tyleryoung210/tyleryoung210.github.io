				<h1>Hello, and welcome to my website!</h1>
				<p>If I had to describe myself in two words, I would probably say passionate and creative.</p>
				<p>My passion is expressed in many facets beyond computer science, whether it be in aesthetics, sports teams I support, or music artists I listen to. People who know me know that I <em>love</em> anything to do with adidas, Manchester City, or Donald Glover for example.</p>

				<p>I say creative mostly because I like considering things from different perspectives. I wrote a 4000 word essay in high school about the first Macintosh from a historical perspective, and something that resonates with me with the research from the essay is the motto "Think Different." While in some ways it can be a cliche quote, it still holds value, especially with me. Being "basic" is an adjective I do not want to be known as, but rather, "interesting."</p>

				<p>Career wise, I aspire to be a software developer once I graduate in May 2020 with an awesome company. Right now my current interests are in both front-end and back-end software development, whether it be with a website, app, or even new stuff like with mixed reality. Right now, I am in this phase of trying out anything I am interested in, and I look forward to continuing this journey!</p>

				<h1>Hackers@VT Website</h1>
				<p><strong>Still a work in progress!</strong> I am currently working on making the first edition of Hackers@VT's website, a student organization at Virginia Tech! This is more of me playing around right now and making more than one version. I have been playing around with the Materialize framework for this project. I will provide a link once I finish it!</p>

				<h1>Personal Website</h1>
				<p>This website you are on is something I made from scratch! I suppose this is version 3.0. I update this website as I learn significant steps in learning web development, when the design grows old on me, and when I have free time. </p>

				<h1>To-Do List Webpage</h1>
				<p>This (not on the internet) webpage was me experimenting with DOM Manipulation and jQuery along with a Udemy course I am kind of following along with as a guide. It has add and remove functionality, but it does not save anything.</p>
